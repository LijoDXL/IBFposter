## Title
Ocean response to Tropical Cyclone Vayu

## Abstract
A very severe cyclonic storm Vayu which is unique in many aspects originated
near the southeast Arabian sea with multiple curvatures on 10-June-2019 and made
landfall on  17-June-2019. We have simulated the storm using a coupled
ocean-atmosphere model. The coupled system has its ocean component as Indian
Ocean HYCOM setup at INCOIS and WRF-NMM core as the atmospheric part. Cyclone
induced cooling was prominent along the westward recurved path and a maximum
cooling of 3.5 °C was observed. Spatial extent and magnitude of model-simulated
SST cooling agreed well with satellite observations. During the initial
northward movement of the storm, it closely followed the shelf break till it
made the first curvature. During this period, warm water (>28 °C) was present
along the west coast of India for the entire depth of water column. Thus, warm
water on the right side of the cyclone track suppressed the SST cooling before
the first curvature. A right-ward bias in maximum mixed layer depth (MLD) is
evident in the model simulation, which confirms that wind mixing of the whole
water column near the coast. However, the lack of a vertical thermal gradient
caused poor surface cooling expected due to entrainment. A shallow mixed layer
(MLD<40m) and a low TCHP (<60 kJ/cm^2) might have contributed to the weakening
of the  storm after the first curvature.

## HWRF model grid
The inner two nests follows the storm. Note that every 10th grid point is plotted here
in both x and y direction for better visualization.
The following nest movement is from the cycle initialized at 2019-06-11 00UTC.
